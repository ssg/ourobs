# ourobs
this was an experiment about a self-hosted, fully decentralized social platform.

# how it works
ourobs stores everything in the URL, so, you can share your content by sharing
the URL with others. when others open up your timeline, they can add their content, and
share the nwe URL with you.

since everything's stored in the URL, no storage or servers are needed.

you can reset your ourobs instance by visiting an empty instance such as https://ssg.github.io/ourobs/

there's a limit to how big data URLs can be, so you may not go that far.
